                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>
            
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>The second project is related to development of a program that creates custom spotify playlists allowing the user to 
            add songs based on specific time stamps of their favorite songs. This allows the user to listen certain parts of songs without having to skip along 
            to parts in which they want to listen.
